# Sinclair Case & Keyboard
A new case and keyboard for the Timex Sinclair 1000 computer

Includes design files for:
* acrylic case
* keyboard pcb
* keyboard plate
* keyboard flat flex cable

### Case
The case was designed using Inkscape and cut at Ponoko using their 3.00mm "Black Matte Acrylic"

The text was painted using Tamiya "TS-27 Matt White" and Testors "1250T Flat Red"

### PCBs
The boards were designed in Eagle CAD and fabbed at JLCPCB

The plate is 1.2mm black FR-4 (select "Remove Mark")

The flex cable is 0.11mm with a 0.20mm polyimide stiffener

### Keyboard
The switches are blue Redragon low profile

The keycaps were taken from a Redragon K603 keyboard

The key labels come from [4keyboard.com](https://www.4keyboard.com/commodore-keyboard-stickers/647-3006-sinclair-zx-spectrum-non-transparent-keyboard-stickers.html)

# Modifications
The motherboard has to be modified to fit the new case. This means removing the RF modulator, voltage regulator, and heatsink.

I chose to replace the modulator with a composite video board from [Ginger Electronic](https://www.ginger-electronic.com/en/retro-computer/21-zx8-ccb-video-mod-for-sinclair-zx80-and-zx81.html).

The regulator was replaced with a generic buck converter that fits in the TO-220 footprint.
